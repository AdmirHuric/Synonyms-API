Reeinvent Interview: Node application

Before cloning the project, make sure to use:

- Node `v18.17.1`
- Npm `9.6.7`

After cloning the project run: `npm install`

Start the app with `npm run dev`, this will start the service on `localhost:3000`

Build the app with `npm run build`, this will bundle the app under `/build` folder

Run the tests with: `npm test`

Live version of the service is running on [Render](https://synonyms-api.onrender.com)

Since Render spins down the service after inactivty for free users, initial request is **SLOW**
